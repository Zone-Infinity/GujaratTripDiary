# Gujarat Trip Diary (Dec 2025)

A personal 5-day trip report from a Gujarat road trip  
(started on **21 December 2025**).

This is more than a travel log.
It captures timelines, reflections (TL;DR + Manogat), and how a group
unexpectedly bonded over a few days.

## Note to future me

Don’t forget this.

This diary can later be turned into:
- a blog post
- a portfolio case study
- or an example of human-centered documentation

The value here isn’t the trip itself,
but **how the experience was observed, structured, and written**.

## Note for GitHub Viewers

This website was put together in a short time purely to present the trip report.

The content comes from real-time notes and short WhatsApp messages shared during the trip.
ChatGPT was used to help structure, clean up, and present this information in a readable format.

The focus here is **documentation and storytelling**, not building a fully polished web product.
